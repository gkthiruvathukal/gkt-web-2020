title: Site migration - back to Jekyll + al-folio

---

It has been a great run with Sphinx for my web site.
After a great deal of consideration, I decided to move back to Jekyll, is much more appropriate for personal sites.

I really like the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme, which has been designed by academics for academics.
It has a ninimal look, supports responsive themes, and (most importantly) allows me to focus on my published work and active research projects.

Being able to do occasional news and blog postings is also a *big plus*.
