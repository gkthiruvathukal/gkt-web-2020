### Getting my CV

See [the latest release of my CV](https://github.com/gkthiruvathukal/cv/releases/latest). This allows you to download PDF for the CV and a BibTeX file for all known publications.

### Technical Notes

My CV is released on GitHub using the lovely [moderncv](https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv) class.
Whenever there is a major update, the Travis-CI (continuous integration) system builds a new (latest) version.
I will be making a blog post (and linking it here) soon, if you want to do something similar for yourself.
