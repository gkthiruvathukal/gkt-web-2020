Please note that all of my courses are built upon open-everything principles: open source, open access, and open data. This allows students enrolled in my courses to avoid unnecessary *additional* costs. Beyond my own students, everyone in the world is also a potential student of mine, even if you are not a student at Loyola University Chicago.
