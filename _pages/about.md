Hi! You've reached the one and only home page of Professor George K. Thiruvathukal.

I earned the Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in computer science from Illinois Institute of Technology in 1995 and 1990, respectively, and B.S. in computer science and physics (double major) with a mathematics minor from Lewis University in 1988.
As a computer science major, I received the department's top computer science graduating student award and was inducted into the [Sigma Pi Sigma](https://www.sigmapisigma.org>) Physics national honor society.

My primary research training is in the areas of high-performance computing, distributed systems, and software engineering with an emphasis on techniques to support parallel and distributed programming using modern software engineering practices, languages, and paradigms (e.g.Â object-oriented design and functional programming).
Lately, I have been spending a significant amount of time on addressing software engineering in machine learning and computer vision.

My doctoral research focused on object-oriented approaches to parallel programming and the development of object models, languages, libraries, middleware, and tools for parallel programming, which incorporated elements of dataflow computing, actors, and computational agents, resulting in several research prototypes written in the C and C++ languages on Unix platforms.
After completing and defending my disseration, I re-implemented many of the ideas from my dissertation in the Java programming language, which resulted in a book, [High-Performance Java Platform Computing](https://ecommons.luc.edu/cs_facpubs/3/) which was published by Prentice Hall and Sun Microsystems Press. The concurrent and parallel ideas in our book (and accompanying programming library) were cited by [JSR-166 (Concurrency Utilities)](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=166) as a related/existing work.

More detail can be found in my longer bio (to appear soon).
