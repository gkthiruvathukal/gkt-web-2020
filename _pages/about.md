Hi! You've reached the one and only home page of Professor George K. Thiruvathukal.

I earned the Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from [Illinois Institute of Technology](https://iit.edu) in 1995 and 1990, respectively, and B.S. in Computer Science and Physics (double major) with a Mathematics minor from [Lewis University](https://lewisu.edu)  in 1988.
As a Computer Science major, I received the department's top graduating student award.
As a Physics major, I was inducted into the [Sigma Pi Sigma](https://www.sigmapisigma.org>) Physics national honor society.

My doctoral research focused on higher-level approaches to concurrent, parallel, and distributed programming with an emphasis on models, languages, libraries, middleware, tools, and techniques.
The culmination of this research was a book in Sun Microsystems Press and the development of a class library, which was cited as prior art and related work in [JSR-166, Concurrency Utilities](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=166) (a.k.a. `java.util.concurrent`).

My current work addresses software engineering for science and machine learning; low-power computer vision; computational neuroscience; crowdsourcing to aid in classification and machine learning; platform studies/gaming studies; computing education; computing history; and [digital music](https://lute.luc.edu).

Beyond academic computer science, I have a strong interest in information technology; ethical, legal, and social issues in computing; entrepreneurship; and broadening participation in computing. See the [Software and Systems Laboratory](https://ssl.cs.luc.edu) for more details!

Selected publication, past and present, are included below.
