Hi! You've reached the home page of `(Prof.|Dr.)? George K. Thiruvathukal`.
The regex syntax indicates that it is optional to use *Prof.* or *Dr.* (and their expanded forms) when addressing me.
I am on a first name basis with just about everyone, which is a tradition passed on to me by my PhD advisor, [Thomas W. Christopher](https://tools-of-computing.com), who always insisted that I call him *TC* (tee-cee) from the moment we started working together at the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1988.
Most people struggle with *Thiruvathukal*, so using *George* is not only encouraged but highly recommended.

So here is a little bit about me.
I earned the Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from [Illinois Institute of Technology](https://iit.edu) in 1995 and 1990, respectively, and B.S. in Computer Science and Physics (double major) with a Mathematics minor from [Lewis University](https://lewisu.edu) in 1988.

As a Computer Science major at Lewis University, I received the department's top graduating student award; 
as a Physics major at same, I was inducted into the [Sigma Pi Sigma](https://www.sigmapisigma.org/) Physics National honor society.
During the summer of my junior year, I worked with [Philip J. Hatcher](https://www.cs.unh.edu/~pjh/)  at the University of New Hampshire on a [NSF](https://nsf.gov)-funded summer REU program focused on compiler construction, where our tools led to the development of Data Parallel C, a portable C dialect inspired by the C\* Language used to program the Connection Machine.

My doctoral research focused on higher-level approaches to concurrent, parallel, and distributed programming with an emphasis on models, languages, libraries, middleware, tools, and techniques.
The culmination of this research was a book in Sun Microsystems Press and the development of a class library, which was cited as prior art and related work in [JSR-166, Concurrency Utilities](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=166) (a.k.a. `java.util.concurrent`).

Simultaneously with my doctoral studies, I worked in the computing and engineering industry from 1989-1996 for Technology Advisors (a private consultancy), Tellabs, R.R. Donnelley and Sons, and Metromail (now Experian).
Upon completing my PhD in 1995, I was a postdoctoral computer sciensist at Argonne National Laboratory, where I worked with [Ian Foster](https://www.anl.gov/profile/ian-t-foster) *et al* on grid computing and getting messaging middleware (Message Passing Interface) to work on the first version of Globus.

My current work addresses software engineering for science and machine learning; low-power computer vision; computational neuroscience; crowdsourcing to aid in classification and machine learning; platform studies/gaming studies; computing education; computing history; and [digital music](https://lute.luc.edu).

Beyond academic computer science, I have a strong interest in information technology; ethical, legal, and social issues in computing; entrepreneurship; and broadening participation in computing. See the [Software and Systems Laboratory](https://ssl.cs.luc.edu) for more details!

Selected publications--past and present--are included below. Feel free to browse my [publications](/publications/) for my body of work.
